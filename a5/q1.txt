This is a livelock problem. This is because all the angels are looking at each other but doing nothing.
This is indefinite postponement as all the angels start looking at each other at the same time.
In a deadlock, a resource is claimed but a task/angel will be waiting on another resource. Here
the angels are essentially doing nothing because they are not supposed to be looking at other, and
hence suffer from simultaneous arrival "you go first" problem.
